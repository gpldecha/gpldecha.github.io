<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>

<p>The aim of this project is to learn a belief space policy \(\pi_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}: b \mapsto a\), which takes as input a probability distribution over the state space \(b\) (belief) and outputs an action \(a\), to accomplish a <strong>search task</strong> given <strong>no visual information</strong>.</p>

<p>When the state space (robot&#8217;s position) is not fully observable it is necessary to represent and consider all hypothetical positions during state estimation and planning in order to act optimally. An optimal control policy can be found by formulating the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) (the partiality arises from   the lack of any visual sensory information) and resolving it via Value Iteration (VI).</p>

<p>This is only feasible when the both the action and state space are discrete which is not naturally the case when considering robotic systems.
I propose a method in which a POMDP policy is learned from a set of demonstrations provided by an expert teachers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>\(x \in \mathbb{R}^3\), Cartesian position of end-effector.</li>
  <li>\(a \in \mathbb{R}^3 = \dot{x}\), Cartesian velocity of end-effector.</li>

<p>We added between the probability distribution and policy a compression function \(g\). The motivation
behind this component is that it is infeasible to directly learn function of
\(b\) as it is of high dimensionality. It is thus preferable to compress it to
a low dimensional representation whilst retaining most of the information.</p>

\[F = \begin{bmatrix}
    \hat{x} \\[0.3em]
    U       \\[0.3em]
    \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^4\]

<ul>
  <li>\(\hat{x} = \arg\, \max\limits_{x_t}  p(x_{t} \lvert a_{1:t},y_{0:t})\), end-effector&#8217;s most likely position.</li>
  <li>\(U = H\left( b \right) \in \mathbb{R}\), entropy.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="task-and-approach">Task and approach</h2>

<p>Our approach to learning the belief state control policy for our search task is based on <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Robot_learning_by_demonstration"><em>Programming by Demonstration</em></a> (PbD). In this framework an expert
teacher (usually a human) demonstrates to an apprentice (the robot) how to accomplish the task.  In this project the
task was to search for a wooden block on a table whilst deprived of sight. As such when the human teacher is performing the
search task the robot apprentice must infer the teacher&#8217;s beliefs such to associate them with his actions in order to reproduce
the demonstrated behavior. The <a href="#concept">Figure</a> below, illustrates the transfer of the search behavior. Before the teacher
starts the search his hand is positioned above the table (location #1) and the belief is assumed to be uniform (center illustration, red
  probability distribution).</p>

        <p class="image-caption"> <b>Figure: Learning to search from human demonstrations</b> <a name=""></a> <b>Left</b>: start of the search, the human has his hand located above the table in position #1 and moves his hand downwards to
            position #2. <b>Center</b>: the belief is initially uniformly distributed (illustrated by the red density) until a contact is made with the table. <b>Right</b>: after inferring the beliefs of the human and observing his actions the robot learns to reproduce the behavior.</p>
      </div>
  
</div>

<p>The actions of the human teacher were recorded by a vision tracking system (<a href="http://optitrack.com/">Optitrack</a>) which was also used to infer
the tactile and haptic sensations, \(y\). These two components are then used to update the belief following the standard Bayesian recursion.
Given that we have access to this information we can proceed to apply the PbD methodology, whose steps are detailed in the section below.</p>

<h3 id="programming-by-demonstration">Programming by Demonstration</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Gather a data set of demonstrations from the teacher: \(\mathcal{D} =  \{a^{[i]}_{1:T},b^{[i]}_{0:T} \}_{i=1:M}\), where \(i\) is the index of
the \(i\)th demonstration (trajectory).</li>
  <li>Compress all recorded beliefs to feature vectors \(F\).</li>
  <li>Learn a generative joint distribution of the actions and compressed beliefs: \(\pi_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(a,F)\)</li>
  <li>Extract an action from the conditional and use it as a control command for the robot: \(a \sim \pi_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(a \lvert F)\)</li>
</ol>

<p>In our setting we used a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as the generative joint distribution:</p>

\[\pi_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(a,F) = \sum\limits_{k=1}^K w^{[k]} \mathcal{N}([a,F]^{\mathrm{T}};\boldsymbol{\mu},\boldsymbol{\Sigma})\]

<p>The parameters \(\boldsymbol{\theta} = \{w^{[k]},\boldsymbol{\mu}^{[k]},\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{[k]}\}_{1:K}\), are the weights, means and covariances
of the individual Gaussian functions, \(\mathcal{N}\). The number of Gaussian components was chosen via model selection with the
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and the fitting of the parameters was done with Expectation-Maximisation (EM).</p>

<p>A human teacher gives a demonstration on how to achieve the task (find the wooden green block on the table) given
that he is blindfolded.

<p>The position of the teacher&#8217;s hand is recorded with an vision tracking system (I was using <a href="http://optitrack.com/">Optitrack</a>). The
sensations the human perceives are inferred from the geometric relation of his hand with a model of the environment which
is known a priori.</p>

<p>From multiple demonstrated searches a dataset \(\mathcal{D}\) is obtained from which a
generative GMM model is learned.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>When the GMM joint distribution \(\pi_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\dot{x},\hat{x},U)\) is conditioned on the belief state \(F = [\hat{x},U]^{\mathrm{T}}\), it
becomes a distribution over actions \(\pi_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\dot{x} \lvert \hat{x},U)\). One way of choosing a control velocity to apply
is to take the expectation of this distribution \(\dot{x} = \mathbb{E}\{ \pi_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\dot{x} \lvert \hat{x},U) \}\). Taking
the expectation of the conditional is known as Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR). <a href="#gmr_vid">Video GMR</a> illustrated the behaviour of
GMR on a pac-man agent positioned on top of the table.</p>
