I"”<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>I am Guillaume de Chambrier and I am from Switzerland but I hold both Swiss-British nationalities. My origins
go back to the canton of Neuch√¢tel but I have mostly lived in Avry, Fribourg when being in Switzerland.<br />
I graduate from the University of Edinburgh with a first class degree in Informatics and I later
obtained a Ph.D in robotics from EPFL.</p>

<p>I started this website for a three reasons.</p>

<p>The first was simply a means of marketing myself and showing the various <a href="/projects/">projects</a> I have
been working on over the years.</p>

<p>The second reason is that I have a passion for Machine Learning and Computer Science. A
website like this one allows me to concisely document my insights and ideas such that
they are clear to me and others.</p>

<p>The third reason is that it gives me my very own platform to rant about various
political-social topics.</p>

<p>Get in touch with me, for any reason !</p>

<p>tch√ºss</p>
